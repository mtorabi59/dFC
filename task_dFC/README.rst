PydFC: task_dFC Module Documentation
=======================================================

The ``task_dFC`` module provides a scalable, open-source Python solution for the **large-scale benchmarking and application of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) methods**.

Its core purpose is to apply end-to-end analytical workflows to fMRI data to assess the efficacy of various dFC methodologies in **predicting moment-to-moment cognitive states**-specifically, distinguishing between moments of task engagement versus rest at the single repetition time (TR) resolution.

Methods Implemented
-------------------

The module supports a diverse selection of seven well-established dFC methodologies implemented within the PydFC toolbox :

*   **State-free Methods:** Designed to capture continuous fluctuations in connectivity .

    *   Sliding Window (SW).
    *   Time-Frequency (TF).

*   **State-based Methods:** Designed to identify recurring, discrete connectivity patterns or states .

    *   Co-Activation Patterns (CAP).
    *   Clustering (SWC).
    *   Continuous Hidden Markov Models (CHMM).
    *   Discrete Hidden Markov Models (DHMM).
    *   Windowless (WL).
Analysis Pipeline: Script-Based Workflow
---------------------------------------

The ``task_dFC`` workflow starts assuming that fMRI data (in BIDS format with ``events.tsv``) has undergone standard preprocessing (via fMRIprep) . The subsequent analysis is executed sequentially through the following scripts:

1. ``nifti_to_roi_signal.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Function:** Runs denoising and extracts regional BOLD time series from preprocessed NIfTI data .

**Details:** Voxel-wise BOLD signals are parcellated, typically using an atlas such as the Schaefer 100-region atlas, yielding regional time series that serve as the input for dFC assessment.

1. ``FCS_estimate.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Function:** Estimates Functional Connectivity States (FCS) .

**Details:** This script fits the dFC model required by **state-based methodologies** (CAP, HMM, Clustering) that rely on identifying **group-level recurring patterns** .

1. ``dFC_assessment.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Function:** Computes individual-level dFC patterns .

**Details:** The script applies the seven implemented dFC methodologies (SW, TF, CAP, etc.) to the BOLD signals of each run and subject to obtain the corresponding high-dimensional dFC patterns .

1. ``ML.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Function:** Implements the core machine learning pipeline, including cognitive state labeling, feature extraction, supervised classification, and separability analysis .

**A. Task Presence Labeling**
*   Initial stimulus timings from ``events.tsv`` are convolved with a canonical **Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF)** to account for hemodynamic delay .
*   The HRF-convolved signal is binarized using a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** to assign time points as "rest" or "task-present" . This process critically identifies and removes ambiguous **"gray zone" time points** corresponding to transitions, improving classifier performance .

**B. Feature Extraction and Reduction**
*   **State-free Methods (SW, TF):** DFC matrices are vectorized (e.g., 4950 connections for Schaefer 100-region atlas) . **Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE)** dimensionality reduction is applied to make the high-dimensional discriminative information accessible to classifiers .
*   **State-based Methods (CAP, HMM, etc.):** Features are derived from state probabilities, distances from states, or state weights . These resulting compositional features (shape (time, states)) are transformed using an **isometric log-ratio (ILR) transformation** .

**C. Prediction and Evaluation**
*   A **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel** is trained to predict the cognitive state (rest vs. task) at the single-TR level .
*   **Balanced Accuracy** is used as the primary metric, ensuring chance performance is 50% .
*   **Cognitive State Separability** is quantified using the **Silhouette Index (SI)** to evaluate whether task and rest samples are intrinsically distinguishable in the feature space without supervision .

1. ``generate_report.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Function:** Summarizes classification efficacy and separability results for individual datasets and paradigms .

**Details:** Generates figures, tables, and reports (e.g., heatmaps and boxplots) documenting Balanced Accuracy and SI scores across methods and paradigms.

6. ``multi_dataset_analysis``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Function:** Contains scripts for aggregating and comparing results across multiple datasets and paradigms.

**Details:** Facilitates **large-scale benchmarking** by calculating aggregate performance statistics (e.g., accuracy distribution) across the 17 datasets and 29 task paradigms analyzed.
