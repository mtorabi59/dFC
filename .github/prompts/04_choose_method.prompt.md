# Help Choose a dFC Method

Ask the user:

1. Is your data single-subject or multi-subject?
2. Do you want:
   - Continuous connectivity estimates
   - Discrete brain states
   - Frequency-specific dynamics

Use answers to recommend:

- SW → simple, continuous
- TF → frequency-specific
- CAP → intuitive states
- SWC → windowed states
- HMM → temporal modeling
- WINDOWLESS → avoid window size dependence

Keep explanations short.
